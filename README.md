#Your Friends:
display: inline-flex;
justify-content: space-evenly; (especially this)

#Tech:
HTML, vanilla CSS, Javascript, Node, Angular, Express

#Issues:
You would think that if you wanted to ng-include a variable value,
such as with ng-repeat, it might look something like this:

```<div ng-include="'{ctrl.value}'">```

Ohhhh no.  It is
```<div ng-include src="ctrl.value">```

I fought with this for so long, trying different things before looking it up.
Weird
